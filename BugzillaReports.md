BugzillaReports generates great looking reports from Bugzilla which you can include in your MediaWiki pages (or in fact any PHP application). Great to provide access to Bugzilla info, for example:

Generate release notes when you release

Generate roadmap reports for what's coming in a future release

Generate your personal task radar - what should you be doing next

Access controlled reports - if you want to expose bugzilla summaries to those who don't have access to Bugzilla

Provide reports easy for non-techies to read.

Please do get in touch with me @ http://twitter.com/ianhomer if you can assist.
