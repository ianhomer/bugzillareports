BugzillaReports generates great looking reports from Bugzilla which you can include in your **MediaWiki** pages (or in fact **any PHP application**). Great to provide access to Bugzilla info, for example:

  1. Generate release notes when you release
  1. Generate roadmap reports for what's coming in a future release
  1. Generate your personal task radar - what should you be doing next
  1. Access controlled reports - if you want to expose bugzilla summaries to those who don't have access to Bugzilla
  1. Provide reports easy for non-techies to read.

Displays dependency reports, last comments for bug when you hover over the bug, supports interactions with voting & flagging and helps you to see what needs to be done next. Read below for more bells and whistles. Makes reporting on your bugs much easier than through the standard Bugzilla search UI. It's your controlled window onto Bugzilla ...

See http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:BugzillaReports for more details, full documentation, screen shots and worked examples.

Unfortunately my attention has been taken over by other priorities.  Given that I know many people do still use and get a lot of benefits from this addon - I would be happy to hand this project over to some one who'd like to take on ownership.  Please do get in touch with me @ http://twitter.com/ianhomer if you can assist.
