# 1.1 Milestone #

The next milestone release will be 1.1.  A tentative release date for this is the end of April 2009.  Work will take place on trunk - if you wish to pick up an early release to address an issue fixed then you're welcome to check source direct out of trunk.  We will endeavour to keep trunk working, but do report any issues with trunk if you do encounter any.

At any point of time you can read the [release notes](http://code.google.com/p/bugzillareports/source/browse/trunk/RELEASE-NOTES) for this 1.1-SNAPSHOT release

# 1.4 Milestone #

I (wpmccormick) became actively involved with this project because I wasn't satisfied with how detailrows is (was) working. I made some changes that (at this point) contained in the 1.4 branch.

If you use BugzillaReports, and are in a position to test 1.4; please do so and let me know if you have any problems.

# Futures Milestone #

The **futures** milestone is a marker for tasks that we set no expectations for addressing.  This can be for a few reasons:

  1. Not known how to do
  1. Difficult or time consuming
  1. Not clear enough use case / benefit
  1. Open debate on best way forward for it
